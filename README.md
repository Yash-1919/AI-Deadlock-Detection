Project Title: AI-Powered Deadlock Detection System

Project Overview
The AI-Powered Deadlock Detection System enhances traditional deadlock detection by incorporating machine learning techniques to predict and prevent deadlocks before they occur. This system analyzes process dependencies, resource allocations, and past deadlock patterns to provide intelligent decision-making for deadlock prevention and resolution.

•	Implement classical deadlock detection algorithms such as Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) and Wait-For Graph (WFG), along with AI-based predictive models.
•	Provide real-time monitoring and graphical visualization of process-resource dependencies.
•	Suggest effective AI-driven resolution strategies for potential deadlocks.
•	Develop a self-learning model that improves over time using historical deadlock data.
Expected Outcomes
•	A working prototype that detects and predicts deadlocks using AI models.
•	Graphical visualization of process-resource dependencies and AI-generated insights.
•	Performance analysis module with improved deadlock resolution strategies.
•	Historical analysis reports for continuous learning and optimization.

Project Title: AI-Powered Deadlock Detection Tool
Problem Statement
Deadlocks in operating systems occur when a set of processes become stuck, waiting for resources held by each other in a circular manner. Detecting deadlocks manually is complex and inefficient, especially in large-scale systems with multiple processes and resource dependencies. Without an AI-powered detection mechanism, systems may experience indefinite delays, leading to reduced performance and potential failures.
This project aims to develop an AI-Powered Deadlock Detection Tool that leverages machine learning to analyze process dependencies and resource allocations, identifying circular wait conditions with enhanced accuracy. The tool will provide real-time alerts, visualize process-resource interactions, and suggest AI-driven resolution strategies to mitigate deadlock situations effectively.
Solution Approach
1.	Classical Deadlock Detection Algorithms: Implement Resource Allocation Graph (RAG), Wait-For Graph (WFG), and Banker's Algorithm.
2.	AI Integration: Train an AI model using past deadlock occurrences to predict potential deadlocks before they happen.
3.	Visualization & Alerts: Provide a real-time interactive dashboard with deadlock predictions and recommended actions.
4.	Self-Learning Model: Continuously improve AI accuracy by learning from system logs.

Code:-
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

class AIDeadlockDetector:
    def __init__(self, processes, resources, allocation, request, history_data):
        self.processes = processes
        self.resources = resources
        self.allocation = np.array(allocation)
        self.request = np.array(request)
        self.history_data = history_data
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    
    def train_model(self):
        X, y = self.history_data['features'], self.history_data['labels']
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def predict_deadlock(self):
        current_state = np.hstack((self.allocation.flatten(), self.request.flatten()))
        prediction = self.model.predict([current_state])
        return 'Deadlock Likely' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'No Deadlock'
    
Example:-
history_data = {
    'features': [[0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1]],
    'labels': [0, 1]  # 0: No deadlock, 1: Deadlock
}
processes = ['P1', 'P2', 'P3', 'P4', 'P5']
resources = [10, 5, 7]
allocation = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2]]
request = [[0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2]]

detector = AIDeadlockDetector(processes, resources, allocation, request, history_data)
detector.train_model()
